# Bikeshare_project 
This project, will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

# What Software required?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

# Why the project is useful?
This project will provide information to the companies how to attract the users to this type of transportation especially to young generation in the big cities. With the help of the data companies get more information about the age group, genders and the most commonly used destinations. 
Companies want to understand why certain age group, genders and destinations are more popular than others. How they can improve their efficiency with other age groups or with the less popular destination.
They also get information on the most popular hours and days when the users are more active. 
During the popular hours and days does the users face any type of challenges and what are those challenges. 
The data also helps to know does the bikeshare reduce the traffic problems in the big cities. 
The data also provide information on the safety of the users during popular hours and days. Does these bikes can track hazards and update the users ahead of time so they can be safe.
  
# How users can get started with the project?
Have knowledge on python, numpy and pandas. Get the datafile on the bikeshare ride by the users. Make a list what type of information is to gather from these data.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project
This project is maintain by the person who is working on this project and anyone who is interested on this project can contributes.
